# Major Project Proposal

## Description
I am building a minecraft-like survival game that utilizes multi-dimensional arrays and a grid-based movement/placement system.

## Needs to Have List
- A system of grids that are saved and can be loaded into the screen the player is using designated tiles
- Many (at least 7) holdable and placeable blocks
- An inventory system and crafting/small progression system
- At least one entity other than the player, preferably an enemy, that spawns randomly
- BGM
- Start Screen + a tutorial button, with a txt file attached for instructions when clicked
- Sprites
- At least one way for a player to die, ergo a death screen
- Respawn mechanic, ergo a respawn button on the death screen

## Nice to Have List
- Three different entity types, one passive and two hostile
- Diamond-square terrain generation or 2D perlin noise generation
- Larger progression system
- Some kind of liquid movement
- Traps
- A way to dig alongside using designated tiles to go deeper/lower
- Going to the underworld if you dig deep enough
- Doors
- Dynamite
- Buffs/De-buffs
- Naturally generated structures
- SFX
- A way to save/load previously made worlds
- Multiplayer (big maybe)
