# Beta Tester Feedback


## Hanson (Knows Comp Sci)
- Wanted me to display the Y-level so that you know where you are (variable has it as zLevel) (added)
- Wanted me to add a way to die to make the game challenging (added)
- Wanted me to add more sprites instead of solid colours for certain blocks (TBD)
- Helped me patch a bug with pigs not dying properly (added)
- Wanted me to add new tree sprite (not added, it looks fine)
- Wanted me to add hostile entities (not added. Too difficult to do in remaining time.)
- Went out of hole and duplicate player spawned (fixed).

## Hendrik (Doesn't Know Comp Sci (JAVA))
- Seemed to have trouble with figuring out the inventory UI (fixed, made it more obvious as to what to click on and added a "how to play" section with instructions)
- Wanted me to add a way to save the world he made (not possible without back-end coding, too hard so not added)
- Tried to kill pigs and the game crashed (fixed).
